//! Per-page grid-icon voting state machine.
//!
//! Encapsulates the 3-pass voting scheme used by both the artifact/weapon
//! scanners and the lock manager to classify icon status (lock / astral /
//! elixir) across inventory pages.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! Three detection passes run at page-relative item indices 0, 13, and 26
//! (evenly spaced within a 40-item page). Each pass reads a full-screen
//! capture and votes on the icon state of every cell on the page; the
//! majority wins.
//!
//! ### Tie-breaking
//!
//! We want every page to end up with exactly 1 or 3 passes — never 2, which
//! produces an ambiguous majority. Items are handled as follows:
//!
//! - **Items 0–12:** have only 1 pass so far → emitted immediately with that
//!   single pass's result.
//! - **Items 13–25:** the 2nd pass has just run — 2 passes give an ambiguous
//!   vote. These items are *deferred* until the 3rd pass (at index 26) runs
//!   and disambiguates.
//! - **Items 26+:** 3 passes done → emitted immediately with the majority
//!   vote, and any deferred items (13–25) are flushed alongside.
//! - **Partial last page** (scan stops before index 26): the caller invokes
//!   [`PagedGridVoter::final_flush`], which tie-breaks by running a 3rd pass
//!   on the last deferred item's own image, then drains everything.
//! - **Early-stop** (e.g. rarity cutoff at item X < 26): the caller invokes
//!   [`PagedGridVoter::early_stop_flush`] with the trigger item's image as
//!   the tie-breaker. The trigger item itself is NOT emitted (the caller
//!   drops it because it failed a filter); only previously-deferred items
//!   are flushed.
//!
//! ## Payload
//!
//! The voter is generic over a caller-supplied payload `T` carried alongside
//! each deferred item. Scanners use `T = ()`; the lock manager uses
//! `T = (row, col)` so it can re-click the same grid cell later to toggle
//! the lock.
